# RunningApp
### What is it?
A unique 😲 running app that allows any user to compete with his/her previous attempts at running 🏃‍♂ the same distance.

While other developers strive to provide competition between friends🧑‍🤝‍🧑, family🤗, and colleagues🧑‍💼, we follow the brilliant guideline that success🥇🥈🥉 can be achieved only as a result of competing with your own self 🖖

# Inspiration

We were ✨inspired✨ to create RunningApp after being given the assignment📚 for the course "Object-oriented programming"📩 during our sophomore year at DCAM MIPT😏

# Requirements
SDK 24, although SDK 32 is recommended

# Launching
To launch RunningApp and begin the journey of your life you should download the apk file (you can find it [here](https://github.com/nzelenyy/RunningApp/blob/master/RunningApp.apk))
